## Step 5

So far we have successfully created your repository on GitHub, but we need to download this to your machine so you can write your code and then send this back to GitHub. For this we will use GitHub desktop.

Open GitHub desktop and clone the repository. If you have no existing repositories you can do this by clicking the ```Clone a Repository``` button on the opening screen. If you already have some repositories downloaded you can add another on by selecting ```File --> Clone Repository``` from the menu bar.

Click ```Choose...```next to the local path field and browse to sensible location on your machine to save the repository, eg: ```Documents → Dev```.

Once you have selected a folder on your machine click ```Clone``` to download the repository.

## Step 12

You now have an Xcode project to begin coding your solution. Initially you will be presented with the build settings.

</p>

## Step 13

Click on ```main.cpp``` in the left hand toolbar to get started. Xcode will provide you with some initial "Hello World" code.

</p>

## Step 14

As you write your code Github Desktop will keep track of your changes in your ```main.cpp``` file and any other files you add to your project. You should make regular commits to ensure you can fall back to previous versions if things go wrong. To make commits write a descriptive message for the changes you have made and click ```commit to master```.

</p>

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

### Step 15

When making commits you should also push your your work to GitHub this will make sure you have a backup of your work. Most importantly when you are happy with your final solution don't forget to make sure you make one final commit and push to your final code before the deadline. To push code to GitHub click ```Push Origin``` after making a commit.

### Step 16

To check your code has submitted correctly go to your repository on GitHub, the URL for this will be: ```github.com/codelab-i-20-21/utility-app-YOURGITHUBUSERNAME```.

You can also easily get to your repository on GitHub by clicking the ```View on GitHub``` button in GitHub Desktop.
